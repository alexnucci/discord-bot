# Discord Bridge Service

A powerful Discord integration service that bridges your server's events to your workflow tools. Built with Deno and PGMQ, it seamlessly captures Discord events, reliably queues them for processing, and persists them in PostgreSQLâ€”enabling seamless integration with workflow automation platforms like n8n, trigger.dev, Make, or Zapier.

## Why This Bridge?

- **Reliable Event Capture**: Every Discord event is captured, queued, and preserved
- **Workflow Integration**: Direct connection between Discord and your automation tools
- **Scale Ready**: Producer-consumer architecture handles high-volume Discord servers with ease
- **Persistent Storage**: All events are stored in PostgreSQL for flexible downstream processing
- **Built to Last**: Production-ready with automatic restarts, error tracking, and containerization

## Configuration

- **Runtime**: Deno
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL for application data
  - PostgreSQL with PGMQ extension for message queuing (required)
- **Network**: Uses external common-network for service communication

## Features

- Producer-consumer architecture
- Message queue-based processing using PGMQ
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Automatic container restarts
- Separate consumer process
- Production-ready configuration

## Infrastructure

### Components
- **Bridge Service**: Main Discord integration process (producer)
- **Consumer Service**: Dedicated message processing worker
- **Queue Management**: PostgreSQL with PGMQ extension
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration (optional)

### Services
#### Bridge Service (Producer)
- Handles Discord events
- Enqueues messages for processing
- Manages bot interactions
- Maintains Discord connection

#### Consumer Service
- Processes queued messages
- Executes bot commands
- Handles long-running tasks
- Manages database operations

## Database Configuration

### Application Database
- Any PostgreSQL instance
- Dedicated service user recommended
- Stores bot state and data

### Queue Database
- PostgreSQL instance with PGMQ extension installed
- Used for message queue management
- Handles task distribution
- Can be same or separate from application database

## Environment Configuration

Key configurations managed through environment variables (see `.env.example`):
- Database connections (Application and Queue)
- Discord bot credentials
- Sentry DSN (optional)
- Environment designation

## Setup Requirements

1. **Discord Bridge Setup**:
   - Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a bot and get the bot token
   - Enable necessary bot permissions
   - Get the public key

2. **Database Setup**:
   - PostgreSQL instance for application data
   - PostgreSQL instance with PGMQ extension for queuing
     - [PGMQ Installation Guide](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq)
   - Create dedicated database users

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in required credentials

## Usage

### Starting the Service
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Service
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# Bridge logs
docker-compose logs -f discord-bridge

# Consumer logs
docker-compose logs -f consumer
```

## Security Notes

- Keep `.env` file secure and never commit to repository
- Use dedicated database users with minimal required permissions
- Network isolation through Docker
- Environment-based configuration
- Error tracking in production (optional)

## Development

The service is built using:
- Deno runtime
- TypeScript
- Discord.js library
- PGMQ for queuing
- Docker for containerization
